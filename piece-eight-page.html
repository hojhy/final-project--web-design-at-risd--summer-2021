    <p class="piece-writing">Series inspired by Julia Kristeva's "Powers of Horror, An Essay on Abjection"</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">"The place of the abject if where meaning collapses, the place where I am not. The abject threatens life and it must be radically excluded from the place of the living subject, propelled away from the body and depositied on the other side of an imaginary border which separates the self from that which threatens the self." â€“ Kristeva</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">To abject something is to reject and distinguish it from our identity. Sometimes this can be done on a subconscious level based on our primal survival instincts like how we are automatically repulsed by cadavers. The uncanny valley of "I" with our subjective consciousness and the body with lack of "subject" triggers a deeply repressed but unavoidable truth everybody is aware of - inevitable death.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">We are taught that many parts of us are subject to abject as we all inescapably fall victim to the unsolicited projection of others - through parents, family, teachers, peers, social media, society. The problem starts when the trait that is rejected (hence an abject) becomes an integral part of one's ego/identity. As they struggle to redefine their "object", they turn to themselves to look for abjection creating distortion and misalignment of self from deep within.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">The concept of self-abjection explains the development of many psychopathologies. It's so important to un-learn and to not project one's "subject"ive standards on another as that inherently risks creating abjection. Adolescents, the BIPOC community, women, and any societally silenced minorities are especially vulnerable to self abjection in an environment where Western media and postcolonialism capitalist standards predominate. This series is a compilation of my personal "abjects" in an effort to fully integrate them back to me.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">A personal example I think of immediately is my body dysmorphic perspective and how it started when I was introduced and subjected to unwanted judgement and started building an expectation - the "object". Before then I was unaware of "good" or "bad" bodies in general - hence had a healthy subjective sense of physical self. This led to an ambivalent and conflicting sense of identity and somehow simultaneously being ashamed and rejecting it. Oftentimes this leads individuals to fear being perceived because their "objective" sense of self-worth overpowers any subjective values. Over time, especially if left unaddressed, they will start viewing a body part or their whole body as separate from themselves - self abjection. THe painting "Jam" is specifically about this abjection of the body.</p>
