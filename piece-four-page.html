    <p class="piece-writing">To me(s) who get anxious when I'm happy,</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">If you struggle with being content in being happy - it might be important to identify the source of your happiness. When you're so used to surviving, not living, happiness is a foreign and fleeting state of being. It's difficult to learn how to make you your own source of it. The environment was too chaotic when you were too young and helpless. The source of happiness and fulfillment then gets tied to other external circumstances - whether that's others' validation or some sort of security and safety.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">But you can never control fully what happens around you, not can you control how others view you because it's never just about you. It's filtered through their projections of themselves - their perception and where they are in their life. You just can't hold your happiness accountable to anyone else. Nothing is reliable enough. Only through your own validation and doing what brings you joy can you truly be at peace being happy because you know nothing can come and mess it up. If you can stay aligned through the good and bad circumstances (that are unavoidable if you're going to keep living) - what's there to be afraid of?</p>
