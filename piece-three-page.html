    <p class="piece-writing">I used to take a school bus. When I got off at my stop, I would sometimes pick a pebble and kick it on my way home - like dribble it. By the time I got home, I would be too attached to the little rock. I would try to leave it behind and walk away, but I'd always turn around to bring it home with me. I felt so bad leading it behind all alone in the middle of the street. I'd wash it and dry it, give it a name and tuck it away in a small drawer on my desk. By the time I had to move to a new home, I had a drawer full of random pebbles that I couldn't bring with me and I had no choice but to leave them all behind. I cried</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">I'm realizing when I refuse to let some things go, it becomes too heavy and eventually hurts even more when the time comes where I can no longer resist letting go. Maybe if I learned how to walk away back then, I could've spared myself some grief later down the line. The rocks were probably happier back in the soil than my drawer.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">(Or now. Maybe we both needed each other then.)</p>
