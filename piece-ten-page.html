    <p class="piece-writing">Food is more than a necessity to sustain life. We seek food when we seek comfort, companionship, distractions, and pleasure. But to those who suffer from eating disorders, food can be an entirely independent entity of its own. Eating disorders are all too common yet widely misunderstoof. This new series depicts a physical manifestation of my strange, hostile, erotic, awkward, anxious, and repulsive relationship with food</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">Battling an eating disorder is isolating and heavily revolved around self-shame and abuse. By sharing a vulnerable perspective of my personal struggled, I aim to create opportunities for dialogues on something that is often suffered alone and elleviate self-criticism and loneliness.</p>
