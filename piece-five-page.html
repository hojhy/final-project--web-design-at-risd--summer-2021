    <p class="piece-writing">The world we live in thrives off disempowered people. The system makes it impossible to stay present because we're constantly in a cycle of working for something for the future - get a diploma so you get into university, go get graduated so you get a job, a promotion, a raise, a marriage. Society is obsessed with humbling women. Multibillion industries depend and thrive off of the insecurities of women so they keep creating new ridiculous ones. We're taught to look for answers everywhere and from everyone but ourselves when nobody will ever make the judgement call on your life better than you can because nobody has lived your life in your perspective. So as a reminder to myself, here's a high priestess card but as a self-portrait, because we all have the high priestess/priest in us.</p>
