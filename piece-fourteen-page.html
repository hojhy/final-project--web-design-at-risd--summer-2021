    <p class="piece-writing">Comfort women were women and girls, the majority being Koreans, who were trafficked into sexual slavery for the Japanese Imperial Army troops before and during World War II. Estimates of the number of women involved typically range up to 200,000. The victims were often brutally beaten and abducted or coerced.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">Once they were placed at comfort stations, victims were forced to provide sexual servies to men back to back continuously with little to no breaks from 9am to 9pm daily. If they resist, they would get beaten, tortured, or killed. Victims were abandoned in foreign countries when the Pacific War ended in 1945, most of them left with physical disabilities, infertility, and venereal diseases - unable to return home.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">The Convention against Torture obligates Japan to provde assistance, redress, and rehabilitation for victims. Yet, although they have recognized that this sexual exploitation constituted such treatment, Japan has done nothing to address the issues so far, apart from apologies in the 1990s that had been revoked later on. All victims except for one passed away without every seeing justice.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">This series of work deals with the matter of comfort women with an emphasis on the emotional and psychological consequences the victims had to live with, which are aspects that are often heavily disregarded whilst discussing historical events. We often present statistics and facts to summarize and represent events of the past and it only dissociates the audiences from the true horror of these massacres - enabling them to look away and disconnect. The paintings heavily incorporate cultural symbolisms.</p>
