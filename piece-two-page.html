    <p class="piece-writing">Phyllis Webstad was 6. She was excited to wear her new shiny orange shirt that her grandmother gifted just like how she was excited for her first day of Mission school. When she got to the Mission, they instead stripped her and took her shirt away. She never got her orange shirt back. Now the orange shirt is worn in remembrance of each and every Indigenous child stolen from their families, stripped of their identity and heritage, the heart aching atrocities the residentail school system inflicted on them and the children who did not make it back home.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">The Indigenous community had and still has their lives and opportunities taken systematically by the colonizers. The last residential school closed only in 1996 and they're uncovering over 1,500 unmarked grades of children at former residential schools (as of July 4th, 2021).</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">September 30th is Orange Shirt Day in recognition of the Indigenous lives lost, the survivors, the intergenerational impact of the unfathomable horror, and as an affirmation of our commitment to ensure that everyone around us matters.</p>
