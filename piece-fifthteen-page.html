    <p class="piece-writing">Every culture has its own version of Genesis. Creation myths tell how something came into existence, or how a pattern of behaviour or an institution was established and therefore constitutes the paradigms for all significant human acts. These myths also have an immense influence on an individual's frame of reference. They influence the way people think about the world and their place in relation to their surroundings. Because creation myths discuss the "origin", it sets the exemplar archetypes, and in doing so, it becomes a powerful tool to manipulate and control the mass population.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">And it has.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">For example, the Biblical story of the creation of Adam and Eve - one of the most famous and widely adopted genesis myths - has been used as justification for misogyny, anthropocentrism, and capitalism up until now. It teaches that mankind is superior to nature and that the Eart (Apple/serpent) must be subjugated into resources for men - setting a hierarchy. For centuries, this system of hierarchy has been expanding further than species and genders into culture, religion, and race. As we run out of limited resources, the top of the hierarchy will only get more and more exclusive for those already on top.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">The Indigenous Haudenosaunee Nation's creation myth of Skywoman Falling paints a drastically different foundation. In Haedenosaunee belief, the first human, Skywoman fell from the sky and was rescued from drowning by the animals who welcomed her as a new guest to the Earth, treating her with kindness and empathy. Skywoman, deeply thankful, plants seeds as a gift, which leads to a thriving ecosystem for everybody including the animals and her future offsprings. The myth of Skywoman falling creates a fundamental archetype of symbiotic relationship betwen all things instead of a hierarchial structure.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">Rectifying cultural, social, and racial injusticies depends heavily on the collective force of the mass population. Self-awareness is key in building momentum amongst us. The augmented reality aspect of this project is delivered through auditory addition to enhance and intensity the immersion. If you'd life, put on the headphones, enter the world with no structure as the first human, and have fun imagining your first footpring and your own paradise.</p>
