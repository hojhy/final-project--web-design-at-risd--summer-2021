    <p class="piece-writing">Risk is often associated with danger - the worst case scenario. But risk is not a risk if there wouldn't also be the positive outcome - something that is 'worth the risk'.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">Countless scenarios in which things could fall apart play and entangle in my head with almost every decision I make. I've been let down a bit too many times (as we all have) and at some point, I decided being prepared for the disappointment and the disaster that could unfold were much more valuable than getting excited for what good could come out of it.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">But all the risks I've taken and all the disappointing outcomes, not that I look back at it with a little more distance, had all led me to where I am now. And I kinda like where and who I am so all the risks I took - in the end - were all worth it.</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">Don't get tangled up in the paralysis of the worst case scenarios - even if the outcome disppoints you now, I promise it won't lead oyu astray. Not taking the risk - you just stand still. If the reason why you want to take the risk makes you thrilled with excitement and hope - you owe it to the possibility. Like why not?</p>
    <p class="piece-writing">(Also if you're happy where you are, you wouldn't even want to take the irsk at the first place. You're unhappy anyways just do it).</p>
