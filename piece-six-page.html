    <p class="piece-writing">For my best friend/platonic life partner, I know how difficult this decision was for you and I'm so so proud that you're leaping into your passion and what truly makes you excited to wake up everyday. I'm so grateful that you see your light and talent the way it truly is, undimmed by what society and people around you have projected and forved upon you. You have so much more to offer than a dissociative corporate 9 to 5 and I'm so excited to witness where you'll fly to next. I love you very very much.</p>
